This represents the server side for the Firebase project, inclusive of the steps retrieval.

INSTRUCTIONS TO GET STARTED:

1. Ensure that you have a code editor installed on your computer. I used VSCode.

2. Using the terminal navigate to a folder you would like to have all your files.

3. Clone the repository and install the dependencies.

   git clone https://github.com/Developerdae/Step-API.git

   npm install

4. Create a Auth.json file using the same format as Example_Auth.json,

5. Run the command 'npm run dev' in your terminal

6. For testing steps data retrieval for a Google Fit account, at the moment the project is in test mode, therefore you would need to add the email of this user on the Google cloud platform. This can be found under APIs and Services, navigate to OAuth consent screen, and under Test users, select add users.
